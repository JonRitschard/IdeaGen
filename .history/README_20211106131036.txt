**********IdeaGen************

Description:
IdeaGen is a script used to concatenate randomized lists of strings. I made it for brainstorming purposes, hence the name.

Usage:
1. Make lists of strings, a word or phrase, each on it's own line without commas to separate, and add them to the 'lists' folder. 3 lists max by default.
2. Add your paths to 'path_to_files' (/lists/) and 'path_to_save' (/results/) directories. 
3. Change the 'results' variable to however many results you want the program to output. 
. Run the program.
